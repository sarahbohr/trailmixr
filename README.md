# TrailMixr üêª

Inspired by a trip to Yellowstone National Park, TrailMixr is an app that helps people connect with other hikers to hit the trails safely.

While in Yellowstone the summer of 2017, I was unable to go hiking outside of the developed areas because hiking alone in bear country isn't safe. Even when you're not in bear country, it's still much safer to hike or backpack in a group. I was inspired to build TrailMixr so that people can hike anywhere safely.
